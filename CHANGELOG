ssbench (0.3.9)

    * Fix #123: ssbench should detect closed connections and not reuse them.

    * Fix #124: update the README instructions for using ssbench with
    * virtualenv.

    * Fix #117: ssbench cleanup-containers needs to be aware of the policy
      suffix (otherwise no containers are cleaned up).

    * Fix #96: when reporting average time per request, if no time elapsed
      (happens if --noop was specified), ssbench should not print a
      DivideByZero exception. The behavior is changed to print "inf" in such
      cases.

    * Fixed bug in GET where last_byte_latency was being calculated before
      actually reading the data out of the socket.

    * Some operations cannot get a meaningful first-byte-latency, so they
      don't; this is now correctly reported as "N/A".
